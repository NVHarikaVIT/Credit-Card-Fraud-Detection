# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This is the capstone project developed from the core topics taught by Dr. Sabyasachi Parida in a bootcamp - Statify.

# Approach
### Data Preprocessing
1. Handled missing data.
2. Normalized the features to the appropriate range.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Visualized the count of different types of transactions.
2. Plotted a heatmap that finds the correlation between the given variables.
3. Deduced that there is high imbalance of class of credit cards.
### Feature Engineering
1. Selected the features that are more likely to determine the class of a given credit card.
2. Splitted the data into two parts - Training set and testing set
### Model Development & Evaluation
1. Developed some classification models using Machine Learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier etc.
2. Evaluated the model with some metrics like accuracy score, ROC-AUC score, F1-score, Precision etc.
3. Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimise and enhance the model's accuracy.
